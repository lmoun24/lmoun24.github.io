<P> This is a sample writing of mine where the class discussed the misuse of data</P>
<P> In (Mis)Using/Understanding Data, Safiya Noble discusses some of the alarming racist and sexist search suggestions that can come up when you google women of color. 
  She also discusses the federal investigation into google’s wage gap, and in August 2017 when James Damore wrote an “anti diversity” manifesto and many employees of google supported 
  the ideologies he had written about. Some of the same people writing these algorithms and architecture were unashamed to promote racist and sexist ideologies in the workplace and 
  elsewhere, and people were supposed to believe the same employees were developing “neutral” or “objective” search engines and results. Noble also discusses the monopolies in the 
  information and technology sectors, and how this is a threat to democracy.  In “This vast Conspiracy of Memory”, Khalid Warsame writes a collection of stories/ memories that are very 
  significant to him and explains why they are significant and the effect they had on him and how they shaped him into the person he is today. He briefly discusses Google's timeline 
  feature, which shows where you’ve been, how long you’ve been there, and how long you were there each time. He gives us an anecdote about a week he was in Cuttagee and Bermagui, 
  and he did not use his phone at all the entire week, and timeline has no record of it.
