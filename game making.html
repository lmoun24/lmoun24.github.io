Designing a game with twine was an interesting experience. I found it fun to choose a topic or issue to address through game format, and choose my own creative way of addressing the issue. I will admit, I struggled with how exactly I was going to address my issue of college life through a game. I decided to attack it from a lense of an incoming college student spending a full twenty four hours with another college student and going through their life with them and seeing what it would be like to live, eat, and learn on a college campus. I started off by letting players choose a name, and asking what their favorite animal is just to add some personalization.
 I then made players choose their major based on their interests, and customized each major passage to a profession that major can lead to and some colors associated with that field as the text color and background. I then decided to introduce two of my best friends, Vic and Jamie, as mentors for this incoming student. I gave players the option of hanging out with Vic or Jamie, and depending on who they chose to spend the day with, they would do different things. If you decided to hang out with Vic, you could watch a show and do some school work, a very common college student activity, or play video games with Vicâ€™s boyfriend at the game room in the Perkins building at Berks campus, another common activity at berks. 
Part of my goal with this game is to really show what it is like to be a college student and how life can differ as a commuter student or a student who lives on campus, but also showing the similarities between the two. I continued the game with a run to target to get some things. I wanted this to highlight how around college campuses, certain stores have somewhat of a monopoly, simply because they are the closest to the campus and are sometimes the only stores students have access to. I then decided to address the issue of food on college campuses. College campuses can be somewhat of a food desert at times, and it is hard to find options. You only have the dining hall or market, or you have to order food or make your own. All of these options have their benefits and drawbacks, and students have to make a decision surrounding this everyday. 
Lastly, I decided to end with somewhat of a time management test, as this is a key skill for college students. In addition, I had to add some macros to really make my game pop and appear unique. I added some images, customized the text color and background color of almost every page, and as I mentioned before, the name and animal box. This assignment taught me the basics of game design, and I found it very fun and interesting. While it was frustrating to fight with the macros to get them to appear the way I wanted them too and other stylistic things like css, and figuring out structural things like how to link passages together, I had a fun time designing this game, and learned even more about coding and design.
