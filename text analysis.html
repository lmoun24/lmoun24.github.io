    <p>Our first task for the text analysis project was to choose five to seven texts from project gutenberg, download their plaintexts. Next, we had to plug 
them into pulsar, delete the things we did not need from the beginning and end, and save them as a .txt file. After that, we chose a specific text from 
our corpus we established and narrow it down to roughly 750 lines. I chose to mark up my text Famous Violins of Today and Yesterday. I chose this piece
because as a violinist, I am always curious to learn more about the past of my instrument and who pioneered the way to get the instrument to where it
is today and how the violin gained its notoriety, as well as see how the playing technique has changed over time and why those changes were made. We 
were then directed to mark up this text for things such as clarity, structure of the text, and meanings of certain words or phrases people may not 
know. What did I mark up in my text?  I chose to mark up important and influential violinists/composers using the tag <person name=”name”> and 
  then closed it with </person>. I chose to mark this up because that is something I have always been interested in as a violinist myself. I also 
marked up epicenters of violin crafting and composition of music for violins, as well as where some of these prominent violinists/composers were
living and performing. I marked this up using the tag <place Type=”type of place” and name=”name of place”> and closing it with the tag </place>. 
I marked this up because I was interested to see where the art of violin making originated and how it moved around over the years and I was also 
curious about where the epicenters of violin performance and composition of musical pieces for violins.I also marked up some jargon that needs to
be defined for newcomers who may have no idea what those terms mean in order to make the text easier to read. For definitions, I used the tag <define>
  and closed it with </define>.</p>





    <p>Through looking at these specific texts, I learned more about how the art of violin making came to be and what specific
people really pioneered this field and made the art of violin making what it is, as well as how the design of a violin has changed over the centuries. 
I learned about places that were epicenters of violin making and playing, and why luthiers (violin makers) and performers were drawn to these areas. 
Typically they were big cities that already had a prominent art culture which made it easy for musicians to make a living and establish themselves, as
well as meet other artists.I also learned more about specifically women's contributions to music from my text Womens Work In Music. I have always
noticed that men seem to overshadow women in the music world, and I wanted to find something to shed light on womens involvement in music and how 
they have changed music and the ideas that women contributed to music. I think it is important to give notoriety to women and what they have 
accomplished, as oftentimes in history, especially in male dominated fields like art and music, their accomplishments tend to get buried.</p>
    





<p>After our markup, we were tasked with plugging our .txt files into a website called voyant tools, creating a corpus there as well, and 
discovering what this site revealed about all of my texts. This site told me many interesting things about my texts and pointed out some
commonalities that I had not realized before. My use of voyant tools helped me realize that in my texts there was little difference in 
readability indexes, which means most of the texts I found were meant for the same level of reader. Voyant tools also revealed to me that the most
frequent words across my corpus were music, works, theme, work, and songs, which I was not surprised by. Voyant helped me make connections between 
my texts and how to convey those similarities to an audience. Through reading these texts, I was able to discover more about the musical world and 
the history behind my specific instrument and where it came from and how much it has grown and evolved over the centuries and why articles are 
written the way they are written. </p>

<p>This project was very interesting to me, and I had a fun time annotating a text that I was very interested in 
and learning more about a topic I had always been curious to learn more about. This project taught me how to critically look through and annotate an electronic
text and how to use code to specify certain points and bring attention to important details of the texts, such as important people, places, and terms that need 
to be defined or specified so people can better understand and digest the text. This project also taught me why certain texts are structured the way they are and
why certain parts of something you read on the internet may be highlighted and lead to links explaining certain things about a text you are reading, such as why 
the author chose the structure they did, grammatical choices, and certain terms that may confuse you and other readers. This project made me realize everything 
about a text is intentional, and when you are encoding a text, you must be precise and know exactly what you want to convey. Each choice has a meaning, and you want 
to be sure your audience is clear on what that meaning is so there is no confusion and the audience can clearly understand what you are trying to convey about your 
texts and what is important for the audience to grasp and the key takeaways of the text/texts.</p>
