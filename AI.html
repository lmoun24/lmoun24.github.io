      <h2>context:I decided to change elizabot into more of a best friend that you have known for years and trust deeply instead of a therapist, but I did keep some aspects of 
       the therapist chatbot so that it seems emotionally intelligent and like it can understand your emotions. I changed some of the language to be more up to date and less 
       formal so it feels like you are having an everyday conversation with a friend instead of a chatbot. I also decided to frame more of the questions in a helpful way and 
       ask how I could help the person, as well as change the wording so the responses are more accurate and make better sense. I also changed it so it seems like there is 
       already a pre established relationship between a person and this chatbot, so some of the responses reflect a sense of familiarity and knowledge of the person, such as
       my “I’m so glad to see you”, “See you tomorrow”, and “I think you mentioned that” responses I crafted. I did this to really sell the best friend aspect of this chatbot. 
       I kept some of the therapist portions and made them my own, however, I made them less formal, and made them appear more so as a best friend offering advice or consoling
       a person. My goal was to create a chatbot you could tell any problem you had, and it would help you walk through how to solve it exactly like how your best friend would, or 
       should. </h2>
